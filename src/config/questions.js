                <b>Before you begin, please read the following information:</b>\
                <p>This study, conducted by the Digital Geography Lab of the University of Helsinki, is part of the GREENTRAVEL project (2023-2027) funded by European Research Council. It explores the use of street view images, to capture peopleâ€™s perception of street-level environments. The study is conducted with the principle of voluntary participation with prior and informed consent. The findings of the study are expected to produce useful information for urban analytics and planning. </p>\
                <p>The study will take approximately 15 minutes</p>\

                <p>In the first part of the questionnaire, you will answer questions concerning your demographic characteristics. After that, you will proceed to rating images on given characteristics on a rating platform.</p>\
                <p>On the platform, you will be shown a random street image for you to observe. Please spend some time looking at the image, as there is a small delay to pace the rating. You will be presented with <b>two criteria to rate:</b></p>\
                <p><b>Greenery:</b>\
                <i>How much natural vegetation you see in the image, based on your own estimation. On the scale <b>1 (No greenery)</b> means that you do not see any vegetation in the view, while <b>7 (Full greenery)</b> means that only vegetation is visible. </i>\</p>\
                <p><b>Pleasantness:</b>\
                <i>How pleasant do you see the scene as a whole? On the scale <b>1 (Not pleasant)</b> means that you do not find the scene pleasant at all, while <b>7 (Very pleasant)</b> means that you find the scene very pleasant. </i></p>\
                <p>For each image, will select your ratings to the criteria. After rating both, there will automatically be a new image for you to rate. If you want to re-evaluate previously rated images, you can move back in the image queue by pressing the previous image button. After changing a rating, you will be automatically moved to the newest image.</p>\
                <p>You can press any of the images to enter a more focused rating window. You can see the amount of images rated on the bottom right. Feel free to use your browser's zoom function to adjust the images for comfortable viewing and rating </p>\
                <strong>To complete the survey, we ask you to rate at least 100 images. After rating the 100 images, you may end the survey and enter a raffle to win a gift card. You may also continue rating images after the initial 100, if you wish.</strong>\
